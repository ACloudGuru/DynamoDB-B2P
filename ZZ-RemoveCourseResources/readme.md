# Removing Course Resources

If you need to take a break in your studies, either a few days, weekend or longer. Then run the deletetables.py script.
This will remove all course tables, and their associated costs (data, table & RCU/WCU) from your account.
Anyone concerned about additional costs can delete the LabMachine stack - to remove the EC2 instance (n.b this is free for 12 months)
